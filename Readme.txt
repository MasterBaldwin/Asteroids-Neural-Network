--Asteroids Neural Network--
-By Mike Baldwin

This project is my attempt at using a Neural Network refined by a Genetic Algorithm.

The game the computer will train on will be the classic game "Asteroids".

My hope is to not only have the algorithm perform mutations on the next generation but also to have the options to perform "breeding" using the two strongest parents and possibly have the ability to mutate the number of hidden layers in the neural network (I'm not sure if that will negatively affect the genetic algorithm).

The whole thing is done in the Unity game engine.
